# SwiftUI-Recipes

A demo app showing how to fetch data from the server to populate list views, navigate to detailed results and wire in a search field.

### About
This project is a SwiftUI implementation of my goto recipe app example for playing around in new languages / environments.

| üñº| Fetching and displaying images from a `URL`. |
| üîÑ | Adding `UIActivityIndicator` as an unofficial `View` element. |
